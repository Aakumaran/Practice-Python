- ## `for` loop
  - The **iterable** is the object that you will parsing through in a for loop. Generally, this object does not change while the for loop is being executed.

  - The **iterator (loop) variable** is the variable which stores a portion of the iterable when the for loop is being executed. Each time the loop iterates, the value of the iterator variable will change to a different portion of the iterable.

- ## Boolean Expressions
  - `=` is an **assignment operator**
  - `==` is a **comparison operator**
